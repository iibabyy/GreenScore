        <h1>Environmental Impact Assessment</h1>
        <p>At GreenScore, we prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility by assessing the environmental impact of pharmaceutical products. Using an advanced tool powered by MistralAI, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of each drug’s ecological footprint. Our system is designed to assess the environmental impact based on several key factors and assigns an overall environmental impact score, which ranges from 0 (no impact) to 5 (severe impact). This score is meant to help consumers and health professionals make informed decisions about the environmental consequences of pharmaceutical products.</p>
        
        <h2>The Environmental Impact Assessment Framework</h2>
        <p>The core of our assessment is a framework called Barem, which evaluates the environmental impact of medicinal products based on the following factors:</p>
        
        <h3>Persistence</h3>
        <p>This factor measures how long a drug or its components remain in the environment after use. Drugs that persist for long periods, especially in aquatic or soil ecosystems, pose a higher environmental risk. A drug’s persistence depends on its chemical composition, the speed of its degradation in natural environments, and the types of materials it is made from. Our scoring evaluates whether the drug is biodegradable, semi-persistent, or persistent, allowing users to understand its lasting effect on the planet.</p>
        
        <h3>Bioaccumulation</h3>
        <p>Bioaccumulation refers to the tendency of a substance to accumulate in living organisms, often passing through the food chain. Pharmaceuticals that accumulate in organisms can have long-term negative effects on biodiversity and ecological balance. Our system assesses whether a drug has low, moderate, or high bioaccumulation potential based on its chemical structure and interaction with biological systems.</p>
        
        <h3>Toxicity</h3>
        <p>The toxicity score reflects the harmful effects a drug may have on both aquatic and terrestrial life. This includes its toxicity to microorganisms, insects, plants, animals, and entire ecosystems. We carefully evaluate the drug's potential to harm wildlife, aquatic life, and other species, scoring its overall impact based on scientific data and environmental studies.</p>
        
        <h3>Ecotoxicological Effects</h3>
        <p>This factor examines whether a drug disrupts ecosystems, specifically targeting its effects on particular species such as fish, birds, or beneficial microorganisms. For example, drugs may cause reproductive failures or alter the behavior of species in their habitat. Our scoring system takes into account any known or suspected ecological disruptions caused by the drug.</p>
        
        <h3>Degradation Byproducts</h3>
        <p>When drugs degrade, they can release byproducts that are potentially more harmful than the original substance. For instance, the breakdown of certain chemicals can lead to the creation of toxins like benzene, microplastics, or other persistent pollutants. This section evaluates the safety and environmental impact of these byproducts, considering whether any harmful substances are released during the degradation process.</p>
        
        <h3>Release Into the Environment</h3>
        <p>Many drugs enter the environment due to improper disposal, runoff from agriculture, or through wastewater systems. This factor evaluates how drugs escape into the environment, whether through consumer use or improper disposal, and the likelihood of these drugs contributing to pollution. The score reflects the scale and frequency of such releases and identifies whether additional regulations or disposal methods are needed.</p>
        
        <h3>Regulatory Status</h3>
        <p>The regulatory status assesses whether a drug is subject to environmental oversight, such as being banned, restricted, or monitored due to environmental concerns. Drugs that fall under strict regulations often have lower environmental risks due to legal controls that require safer production, use, and disposal practices.</p>
        
        <h2>The Scoring System:</h2>
        <p>For each of these seven environmental impact factors, we assign a score between 0 and 5. Here's a breakdown of the scoring scale:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>0 – No significant environmental impact</li>
            <li>1-2 – Low impact; minimal concern, but some environmental factors to consider</li>
            <li>3-4 – Moderate impact; the drug has significant ecological effects that may require attention</li>
            <li>5 – Severe impact; major environmental consequences or irreparable harm to ecosystems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We then calculate a weighted average based on the severity of each factor to derive an overall environmental impact score. The final score allows consumers to gauge how environmentally friendly a product is in comparison to others on the market.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Barem?</h2>
        <p>The Barem framework is designed to offer a balanced, objective, and comprehensive view of a drug's environmental impact. This method takes into account the full lifecycle of a pharmaceutical product—from production and usage to disposal and degradation—ensuring that we capture all possible environmental concerns. By using data from scientific studies and real-world assessments, our system ensures accuracy and consistency in evaluating drugs. The result is a simple yet powerful tool that can guide more sustainable choices for individuals, healthcare professionals, and manufacturers alike.</p>
        
        <p>Our aim is to encourage a more responsible approach to pharmaceutical use, empowering users to make informed decisions that contribute to the well-being of our planet. With each drug, you'll find a detailed breakdown of its environmental score, mitigation strategies for reducing its impact, and recommendations for safer disposal methods.</p>
        
        <p>We hope that through transparency and education, we can help reduce the environmental footprint of the pharmaceutical industry while promoting better health for both people and the planet.</p>
